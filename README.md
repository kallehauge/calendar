This project isn't ment to be developed any further by myself. The .js file could use some better structure but the code itself if fully functional and should give you quite the starting-points.

I have used the particular version for a school project, where I combined it with ajax and it worked brilliantly.

You can see it working at the demo-page here:

Or in use with my school-project, here:
http://krustykrab.duckdesign.dk/bestil (I can't guarantee that it will be up adn running when you read this).
